# BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS PROJECT WRITE-UP

### **Does Global Office Superstore operate in the most profitable manner possible?**

## Abstract

It's early 2015, and Global Office Superstore has become a household name around with world for office supplies, office-related furniture and business-based technology equipment. However, the company currently sells and ships its entire product line to all 147 countries where it does business without any consideration of localized demand, profit margins or unique customer characteristics.

Fortunately, recent global sales data (all of 2014) was readily available and I performed a detailed analysis to determine where opportunities exist to optimize and increase overall profits. I hypothesized that by identifying products, countries and/or customers associated with negligible or even negative profits, I could recommend suitable corrective measures (including a review of discount policies and perhaps even discontinuing certain products in some locales) to maximize profits and minimize losses.

## Design

Although several years of data were available, the tools used (see below) were stretched to their limit using just the final year's worth (17,531 rows), and this was deemed to be the most appropriate subset since it most accurately represents current business practices at the company. This project was entirely based on using exploratory data analysis and visualization to gain meaningful and impactful business insights that may have been missed up until now by the client (not surprising, given the many complex relationships and layers in the data across many products, markets and customers).  

## Data

The dataset for this project was drawn from the past three years (2011 - 2014) of all sales data for Global Office Superstore, which the company has recently made available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/apoorvaappz/global-super-store-dataset). As mentioned above, just the most recent year (2014) was retained for this project. For every transaction in 2014, this data set includes the order date, unique customer idenfication number, customer market segment (Corporate, Consumer or Home Office), unique product identification number, product category, order quantity,  order discount (if any), sales revenue, profit, geographic details (purchaser city, country, global region), order priority, shipping priority, and shipping cost.

Additional data showing projected 2015 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by country was obtained from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (downloaded from this site: https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm ).  Ultimately, this data was not used in the current analyis, but it may prove to be useful in future  work (namely discount strategies aimed at increasing market share in projected high-growth countries).

## Algorithms

As no models were built for this project, no algorithms per se were required. Data was imported, cleaned, aggregated and summarized in Microsoft Excel to gain specific insights into profitability. Further aggregation and visualization (informed by the Excel results) was performed in Tableu. This process was iterative, with insights gained in one software tool prompting further exploration in the other and vice versa.

## Tools 

The following tools were used in this project:

1. Microsoft Excel (to clean, explore, aggregate and summarize the data set)
2. Tableau to visualize the data set at various levels of aggregation to find useful and informative insights

## Communication

In addtition to presenting final Project Slides to the stakeholders, all work (including the slides) will be available on GitHub: https://github.com/georgepappy/BusinessFundamentals, except for the Tableau workbook, which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/george.pappy/viz/Project_Data_Exploration_16332343098010/Dashboard.
