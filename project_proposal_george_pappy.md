# PROJECT PROPOSAL

##### IS OFFICE SUPERSTORE OPERATING IN THE MOST PROFITABLE MANNER POSSIBLE, OR ARE THERE POTENTIAL AREAS OF INEFFICIENCY OR LOST/NEGATIVE PROFIT THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND ELIMINATED TO MAKE THE COMPANY AS PROFITABLE AS POSSIBLE?

It's early 2015, and Office Superstore has become a household name around with world for office supplies, office-related furniture and technology-based equipment. However, the company currently sells and ships its entire product line to all 147 countries where it does business without any consideration of localized demand or profit margins.

Fortunately, several years of recent global sales data is readily available and I propose to perform a detailed analysis to determine where opportunities exist to adjust the range of regional product offerings and associated pricing. I hypothesize that by identifying products and their associated regions where profitability is negligible or even negative, I can recommend suitable corrective measures (including price adjustments, a review of discount policies, and/or discontinuing certain products in some or all regions) to maximize profits and sales while minimizing losses. Furthermore, additional value may be derived by identifying high value/high profit customers, product lines and markets.

The dataset for this project consists of the past three years (2011 - 2014) of all sales data for Office Superstore, which has been recently been made available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/apoorvaappz/global-super-store-dataset). For every transaction over the three-year period, this data set includes the order date, unique customer idenfication number, customer market segment (Corporate, Consumer or Home Office), unique product identification number, product category, order quantity,  order discount (if any), sales revenue, profit, geographic details (purchaser city, country, global region), order priority, shipping priority, and shipping cost.

Preliminary work will consist of exploratory data analysis of the dataset described above, aggregating and visualizing sales volumes and profits by various granularities, including region/country, market segment, and specific customer volume and profit levels. 

Future work would include building unsupervised learning models to cluster valuable/profitable customers, products, market segments and countries to compare the strong and weak performers and further inform future sales, marketing and growth strategies for each distinct identified group.

The tools required for this project are: 

1. Microsoft Excel (to clean, explore, aggregate and summarize the data set)
2. Tableau to visualize the data set at various levels of aggregation to find useful and informative insights

The Minimum Viable Product for this project will be a collection of tables and Tableau visualizations highligting scenarios where sales and profits are underperforming, accompanies by a preliminary set of recommendations to address such underperformance.
